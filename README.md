I'm making this project to list all the upcoming confernece tech and non-tech both. 

I'm a backend devloper and deveops engineer and trying to find conference where I can apply or which are related to my work but it's really very hard. One option I've is to check for all the conferences which is related to my work or I want to do is by checking one on one i.e visiting large number of websites and related communities which is next to impossible.

So I'm starting this project to help everyone by everyone in finding relevent conferences for them.

We also need to remove the past conferences.

This project is also open for the suggestions.

To contribute fork this repo, add confernece link(following the format) in conferences.txt and create PR.
